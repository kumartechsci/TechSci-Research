The rise in such cases has increased the demand for radiotherapy services across the country.</p>
<p>Additionally, the expansion of the country&rsquo;s healthcare infrastructure, particularly with the government&rsquo;s focus on schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), is fostering growth in the availability and accessibility of advanced cancer treatments. Over 1,500 new hospitals and specialty care centers have been added in the last five years, and many are equipped with dedicated oncology departments, further boosting the radiotherapy device demand.</p>
<p>Technological innovation is also a key growth driver. India is witnessing the introduction of advanced systems such as image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), offering improved precision and better patient outcomes. For instance, Elekta and Varian have launched next-generation systems in India that reduce treatment time and improve accuracy. These improvements are encouraging oncologists and hospital administrators to replace legacy systems with more advanced equipment.</p>
<p>Another supporting factor is the rising number of trained oncologists and radiotherapy technologists. Medical institutions across India are expanding postgraduate seats and offering fellowships in radiation oncology, addressing the earlier challenge of limited human resource capacity. The simultaneous growth in insurance penetration&mdash;life and health insurance together reached over 56% penetration in 2023&mdash;is also increasing patient affordability for costly radiotherapy treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Market Trends Analysis</strong></p>
<p>A significant trend shaping the India radiotherapy devices market is the transition toward precision and personalized oncology treatments. The integration of AI-driven planning software with radiotherapy systems is allowing oncologists to tailor therapies according to individual patient tumor biology and treatment response, which results in higher efficacy and fewer side effects. Companies like Siemens and Philips are developing AI-enabled diagnostic and therapeutic modules that improve workflow and accuracy in radiotherapy.</p>
<p>Another trend is the growing adoption of telemedicine and remote planning in radiotherapy. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a push toward decentralizing oncology services. Cancer care centers in tier-2 and tier-3 cities are connecting with specialists in metro cities via telemedicine platforms to receive remote radiation treatment planning and consultation. This trend is expanding the reach of radiotherapy beyond major urban centers and is expected to improve equity in cancer care delivery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a rising demand for compact, mobile radiotherapy units to cater to underserved rural areas. These devices are designed to be portable and operational in resource-limited settings, offering a pragmatic solution for geographically dispersed populations. Companies are also exploring battery-powered or hybrid-energy models to address power supply challenges in rural India.</p>
<p>Investment in local manufacturing under India&rsquo;s &ldquo;Make in India&rdquo; initiative is another major trend. Companies like Healthcare Global Enterprises and Tata Memorial Centre are partnering with global players to manufacture parts and systems locally, thereby reducing costs and improving supply chain resilience. Moreover, green radiotherapy technologies aimed at reducing radiation waste and power consumption are gaining traction among sustainability-focused institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Market Challenges Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Despite the promising outlook, the India radiotherapy devices market faces several challenges. A key hurdle is the high capital investment required for installing and maintaining radiotherapy systems. A linear accelerator (LINAC), for example, costs upwards of INR 20 crore (USD 2.4 million), including infrastructure and maintenance. This limits the penetration of advanced systems to only high-budget hospitals and specialized cancer centers, leaving a significant treatment gap in rural and semi-urban areas.</p>
<p>Another major issue is the uneven distribution of radiotherapy facilities. According to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), there are only about 550 operational radiotherapy machines in India, while WHO recommends one machine per million population. This indicates a significant shortfall, especially when considering India&rsquo;s population of over 1.4 billion. Patients in smaller towns and villages often have to travel hundreds of kilometers for each session, leading to dropout from treatment cycles.</p>
<p>Additionally, the lack of trained personnel such as medical physicists, radiation therapists, and radiation oncologists poses a bottleneck to effective service delivery. A study from the Association of Radiation Oncologists of India revealed that there is a 40% shortage of trained radiation oncology staff in the country. Coupled with limited continuing education and upskilling opportunities, this results in suboptimal utilization of existing radiotherapy systems.</p>
<p>Also, frequent regulatory delays and complicated licensing processes for radiation equipment discourage smaller players and startups from entering the market. Import duties and taxes on high-end machines further raise procurement costs. All these factors collectively slow down market expansion and innovation, despite the increasing demand for cancer treatment services.</p>
